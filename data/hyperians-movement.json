	"description": "Hyperians Movement was born as a CTO project after the former dev of the old project rugged, and disappeared from the map. Myself and a few other members who minted and lost their funds on that Rug, decided to take over the project and started building Hyperians Movement on their own, having built so far: \nHyperians: 888 NFTs that were released for free to those who were Rug by the former developer. They are crucial to the ecosystem. \nhttps://drip.trade/collections/hyperians \n\n✅ Hyperians Genesis: 1400 NFTs that were minted on the Drip.Trade Launchpad and play a different but also important role in the Hyperian Movement ecosystem. \n\n✅ $MOVE Token: 1 billion supply token that has already been released and airdropped to Hyperian and Hyperian Genesis holders. It is the hub of Hyperians Movement.",
